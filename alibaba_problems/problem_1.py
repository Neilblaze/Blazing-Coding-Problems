"""This problem was asked by Alibaba.
Given an even number (greater than 2), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to the given number.
A solution will always exist. See Goldbachâ€™s conjecture.
Example:
Input: 4
Output: 2 + 2 = 4
If there are more than one solution possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution.
If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b, and [c, d] is another solution with c <= d, then
[a, b] < [c, d]
If a < c OR a==c AND b < d."""
