"""This problem was asked by Jane Street.

The United States uses the imperial system of weights and measures, which means that there 
are many different, seemingly arbitrary units to measure distance. 
There are 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, 22 yards in a chain, and so on.

Create a data structure that can efficiently convert a certain quantity of one 
unit to the correct amount of any other unit. You should also allow for additional 
units to be added to the system.
